# Restaurant Reviews App

This project uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) to show restaurants on map with their reviews. The design is responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. A service worker is employed to create a seamless offline experience for the users. ServiceWorker caches requests to all of the siteâ€™s assets so that any page that has been visited by a user will be accessible when the user is offline.

The project is based on starter code from [this repository](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1). Project demo can be found [here](https://ssaleem.github.io/Restaurant-Reviews-App/)
